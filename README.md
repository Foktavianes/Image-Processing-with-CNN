# Image-Processing-with-CNN
The .ipynb contains image processing for CIFAR10 datasets which contains 4 dimension data.
I am implemented pre-trained model to train the model with pre-trained model, such ResNet50, VGG16,DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, NASNetMobile.

The .ipynb contains loss and accuracy for train and test set and which model is better suited to handle the CIFAR10 datasets
